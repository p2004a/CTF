It was my first CTF. It lasted 48 hours and I have spend around 16 hours
working on challenges. I completed 8 of them worth 1050 out of 3370 possible
points. I'm pretty happy with the result.

The folders contain my solutions with short description. One task was just
opening the pcap file with Wireshark so I didn't included it.
