Gaychal
=======

[s.py](s.py) contains the code that reads the gaychal.php file and starts the
php process, feeds it with a little modified code and in result receives the
code that prints the flag. The [last.php](last.php) contains the PHP code
that prints the flag.

It is true that writing this in PHP instead of Python would be a better idea.
