Capture The Flag
================

This repository contains most of the intermediate files, code and so on
I created to solve tasks in CTF contests I took part in. Moreover it usually
contains very short descriptions of the solutions and contests themselves.

The implementations are quick and dirty. The only goal was finding the flag.
